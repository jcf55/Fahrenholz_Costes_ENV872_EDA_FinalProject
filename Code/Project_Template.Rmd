# Exploratory Analysis 
```{r explore the data}
#dimensions
dim(birds)
#column names
colnames(birds)
#variable types?
str(birds)
#look at the first few lines
head(birds)

```

```{r wrangle the data}
#we should ask where this should go, or if it doesn't need to be shown we can just add this to the chunk above

#columns to keep- i'm thinking we choose the scientific name and a few variables
#leave out the unsexed things because a lot of that is -999
#I don't think we need the species number or subspecies it seems repetitive
birds.wrangle <-
  birds %>%
  select()
