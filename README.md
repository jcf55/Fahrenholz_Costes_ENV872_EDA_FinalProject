## Summary

<describe the purpose of this repository, the information it contains, and any relevant analysis goals. What, why, where, when, how?>

This repository holds the contents related to a Duke Nicholas School of the Environment course titled Environmental Data Analytics. The course was taught during the Spring of 2022, in which this was created. Within it are raw, and processed data files used for analysis of our research questions related to bird data found on an open-source websites. The creators of this repository are in no way connected to the creation of the data set, please see the metadata files for more information and websites.
* add about analysis goals, how we got, what we did etc

## Database Information

<describe the origin of all data in the repository, including data collected from outside sources and new data generated by the investigator(s). If data was accessed from an outside database, the date(s) of data access should also be included.>

This data set was found using www.ecologicaldata.org, an open source website for various kinds of biological data. It was originally accessed on March 29th, 2022 and later altered for analysis purposes using RStudio. Variables from the original data sets that were repetitive, or not relevant to comparative analysis were removed. The original data can be found in the Data/Raw folder, while other data sets created by the authors of this repository can be found in Data/Processed. 


## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 

<describe the folders contained in the repository, including what type of files they contain>

The folders contained within our repository split up our Code and our Data. In the project folder, a README.md file can be found, as seen on our GitHub repository page. The Code folder contains the R scripts used to complete analyses to answer our over arching research questions. The Data folder contains the original data set (Raw folder) and our wrangled data sets (Processed folder).

<describe the formats of files for the various purposes contained in the repository>

Files within our folders were kept only if relevant to avoid cluttering up our work space. The README.md file is set up to explain the data and analysis conducted within this project. Our .Rproj file created the workspace in which we worked through creating our final report. Code files were all written using RStudio and are therefore in .Rmd for easy sharing. Our project template is where analysis was conducted, while the project instructions .Rmd provided guidance for the project at large. 

<describe your file naming conventions>

Files are named conventionally, using the original file name for our raw data set that is associated with the .txt file in the Data/Raw folder. Processed data is named to distinguish it between the raw dataset and all file names will be explanatory as to the contents held within the file. 
## Metadata

<For each data file in the repository, describe the data contained in each column. Include the column name, a description of the information, the class of data, and any units associated with the data. Create a list or table for each data file.> 

## Scripts and code

<list any software scripts/code contained in the repository and a description of their purpose.>

## Quality assurance/quality control

<describe any relevant QA/QC procedures taken with your data. Some ideas can be found here:>
